# spam-this-repo
Repo for testing out all your GitHub MCP's and agents and just do whatever you want.

## Purpose
Are you building a GitHub agent? Are you doing testing with the GH CLI? Instead of bothering someone who's trying to build something useful, for just spam this repo please. Feel free to submit PR's, open Issues, twist it, bop it, pull it - I will try to make the rules as permissive as possible, within the bounds of security and cost. Don't f*ck up GitHub for people who are trying to do something good.

Happy spamming! ðŸŽ‰
